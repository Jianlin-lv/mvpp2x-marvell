ppv2tool Build
==============

* Makefiles:
    Makefile.win	Used for compilation of tool on Windows
    Makefile.linux	Used for x86 linux compilation
    Makefile.linux.arm	Used for cross-compilation of tool on Linux for ARM target

* Toolchains:
    Windows: 	Dev-C++ v4.9.9.2 available as GPL software from www.bloodshed.net
    Linux-ARM:	Cross compiler toolchain for PPv2
    Linux:	native x86 GCC compiler
    
* The two main build targets are: 
   clean - to remove results of previous compilations
   all   - to build the executable
   e.g. make -f Makefile.win clean
        make -f makefile.linux all    
    
* Make sure that the above-mentioned makefiles match your compilation environment.
* Run the env.sh script before make, it will set the cross WIN compiler paths, if your paths differ change accordingly.

win build HOWTO:
================
1) download toochain from: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dev-cpp/devcpp-4.9.9.2_setup.exe 
2) install to c:\Programs\Dev-Cpp
3) update windows PATH environemnt:
3.1) Start --> right click on "My Computer" --> select "Properties" from the menu --> click on "Advanced" tab --> "Environment Variables" tab near the bottom --> click on "Path" in the "System Variables" window panel near the bottom -> click on the "Edit" button.

3.2) Add the following at the end of what is already the value of the PATH variable:
      ;C:\Programs\Dev-Cpp\bin;C:\Programs\Dev-Cpp
4) open cmd.exe in the source code root directory and perform the following to clean/build
4.1) make -f Makefile.win clean
4.2) make -f Makefile.win all
